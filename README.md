# hello-world
Hi All!

My name is Nancy and I am looking to transition into a technology role as a data scientist.  I spend over 20 years in business doing customer and market intelligence, project management and communications. I have always been involved in technology but from the business side.  I have some experience in Visual Basic and have taken courses from Coursera in Python, Javascript, SQL and Tableau.  I especially like data visualization!  

Any suggestions for what I need on my resume to get a job in data science would be much appreciated.

-Nancy
